# StockChartCNN
CNN trained on 1000s of images taken of candle stick stock charts. 

Images were taken for all SP500 stocks for 1 hour, 4 hour, and 1 day time frames (from 2018-2023)
Goal is to predict the next few candle sticks with nothing more than the image. Since stock are as much
emotional as they are quantitative, predicting future prices on non quantitative data and only imagery
is in line with how the participants of the stock market would/could make decisions.
